                   Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website

What is it?
-----------

	The Movie Trailer Website is a simple, yet very practical server-side
	application that produces a website with some of my favorite movies. 
	
	Two buttons are provided below each movie poster image: (*) More details!
	and (*) Play Trailer

	(*) More details! when pressed:
		Shows a modal tht provide information regarding cast, director,
		year and plot.

	(*) Play Trailer when pressed: 
		Creates a frame to present movie trailer for the interested in 
		a tease.
	
	When you click outside the modal or movie trailer are, it is automatically
	closed, and you return to the main page mosaic.

Installation & pre-requisites
-----------------------------

	Requires Python 2.7.9. Might work in recent releases, but haven't been
	tested at all on those.


How to execute
--------------

	Follow following steps:

	o  $ cd P1	#(or complety route depending on where yo placed it)
	o  $ python entertainment_center.py

	Application will: 
		
		(1) launch browser and/or (if browser already opened)
		(2) create a new tab opening the newly created 
		    file 'fresh_tomatoes.html'

How to add more movies
----------------------

	If you are familiar to python and/or some programming experience:

	Insert a new variable containing proper information using following
	convention on file 'entertainment_center.py':

	new_movie_name = media.Movie(
    		movie_name,
    		plot_line,
    		poster_image_URL,
    		trailer_video_URL,
    		director,
    		rating,
    		starring_roles,
    		release_year)

	For example, see line 4 on 'entertainment_center.py'

	toy_story = media.Movie(
    		"Toy Story",
    		"A story of a boy and his toys that come to life",
    		"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/13/Toy_Story.jpg",
    		"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYz2wyBy3kc&spfreload=10",
    		"John Lasseter",
    		"G",
    		"Tom Hanks (Woody), Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear)",
    		"1995")
	
	Make sure to follow after last actual similar declaration of the ones
	already created

	Find following line (currently line 77):

		movies = [toy_story, avatar, fight_club, school_of_rock, ratatouille, \
			star_wars_episode_three, big_fish]

	And add you newly created variable into the comma separated list.
